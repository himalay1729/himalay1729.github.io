“We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.” --  Kurt Vonnegut, Mother Night 

Hi, I am a doctoral student in the Physics department at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). 

Here is a cool picture of mine trekking the hills of Pune, courtesy of Sonakshi Sachdeva.

Look at this cool blog by a friend of mine, [Anudhyan's blog](http://www.boral.co.uk/). If you have already checked this out, in my defense, give it some time. 

I admire the founders of [Libgen](http://libgen.io) and [Scihub](https://sci-hub.tw/) and their contribution to making knowledge free. At [Libgen](http://libgen.io), one can download free books, both scientific and fictions while at [Scihub](https://sci-hub.tw/) one can download journal papers that aren't open access. If [Scihub](https://sci-hub.tw/) is not working, you can check the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) to find a working link.
