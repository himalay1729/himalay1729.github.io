*What is in this book?* The author believes that most of the important ideas and techniques in nonlinear dynamics can be introduced in the setting of the real line or the circle. So, in the first chapter, the focus has been to introduce ideas like structural stability, topological conjugacy, the shift map and homoclinic points in the context of one-dimensional dynamical systems. The second chapter is a study of higher-dimensional dynamical systems while the third chapter describes some works on the complex analytic maps.

**Chapter one: One-Dimensional dynamics**

*Preliminaries from Calculus:* 

Definition: The function $$f: X \to Y$$ is a homeomorphism iff $$f$$ is a bijection (one to one and onto) and both $$f$$ and $$f^{-1}$$ are continuous.
