You can get a copy of the book [here](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/Gbook/PM4DNA_0317.pdf).

*What is in this book?* This book begins with the natural theory of evolution for a homogeneously mixing population of constant size. However, we know that both the assumptions are wrong. A person is probably more likely to meet someone nearby than someone else living farther away and the size of the population is not constant. So, later these assumptions are relaxed and a more realistic theory is developed. A very detailed sketch of what is in the book has been covered in the preface.

**Chapter one: Basic Models** 

 *ATGCs of life:* We begin with a basic description of the genetic code and the notion of recombination. The hereditary information of most living organisms is carried in DNA. DNA consists of two complementary chains twisted around each other to form a double helix. The chains are joined by $$A=T$$ and $$G \equiv C$$ bonds where the $$A=T$$ bond is weaker and separates more easily.

 *The discrete-time Wright-Fisher model:* This model was developed implicitly by Fisher and later explicitly by Wright and is by far the most popular model for reproduction is population genetics.
 
 
 
 *The continuous-time Moran model:*
 
 *The coalescent:*
 
 *A model of mutation; infinite alleles:*
 
  *A model of mutation; infinite sites:*
